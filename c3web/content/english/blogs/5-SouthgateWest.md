The asphalt surface of the heavy duty container pavement had become damaged by the corner posts of the containers stacked on the Southgate West site. North Shore Paving asked Greg to review the conformance tests on the asphalt supplied to the Southgate West site by Fulton Hogan. The conformance tests carried out by Fulton Hogan confirmed that the asphalt that they manufactured and supplied to site conformed to RMS Specification R116.

Greg recommended that he review the pavement design. He developed a finite element model of the pavement which predicted the maximum horizontal tensile stress in the asphalt layer induced by the container posts exceeded that induced by the 100 tonne front axle of the Omega 54D forklift.

Greg's discovery prompted fruitful discussion between North Shore Paving and the head contractor, Dzine Construction Group in January 2015. Discussions between North Shore Paving, Dzine Construction Group and Goodman Property Group have also commenced.
