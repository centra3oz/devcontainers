The project involved widening the rail corridor between Sefton and Macarthur in southern Sydney and installing 36km of bi-directional non electrified dedicated freight line. A large percentage of the materials delivered to and exported from the SSFL construction site were transported via the Fairfield City Council (FCC) local road network. Council estimated that several of its roads sustained $2.5 million of damage during the SFFL construction period.

Greg calculated the percentage of the pavement damage attributable to the SFFL project using a sophisticated apportionment model that he purpose built for the SSFL project. As a consequence of Greg's advice, the Alliance was able to determine that its local road pavement damage liability was less than a tenth of FCC's estimate.
