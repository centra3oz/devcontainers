Bannister Hunter v Transition Resorts

<p>
<hr>

1117 Nelson Bay Road, Fern Bay was filled with Virgin Earth Natural Material (VENM) by Robson Earthworks circa 2007. Bannister & Hunter project managed the design and placement of the earthworks. Coffey Geosciences certified that the "filling was generally carried out to Level 1 as defined in Appendix B of AS3798-2007". However, subsequent geotechnical investigations cast doubt on conformity of the earthworks to AS3798. Bannister & Hunter initiated legal proceedings against Transition Resorts and vice versa.

The case was heard by Justice McDougall who found that the cost of rectifying the VENM non conformities was not precluded by the sale of the site.

Greg's involvement in the case was to inspect the site, review the evidence and prepare an expert report on the compliance of the earthworks to AS3798.
