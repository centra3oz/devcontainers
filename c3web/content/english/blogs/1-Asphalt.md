QDMR had become aware through its interstate benchmarking study that asphalt pavements built in NSW typically cost less than but performed as well, if not better than, asphalt pavements built in Queensland. Greg was appointed to the position of the asphalt harmonisation project catalyst because of his extensive knowledge of RMS Specification R116 and considerable experience in designing, constructing and maintaining asphalt pavements in NSW and QLD.

As catalyst, Greg provided QDMR with invaluable insights into the R116 specification framework and applications. Greg's input was recognised by the harmonisation project leader, Peter Evans (Principal, Pavements Material Geotechnical unit) when he said to his colleagues at the Organisational Change Workshop: "Without Greg's input, the project would have been delayed by at least 6 months".
