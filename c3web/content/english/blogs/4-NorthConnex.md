Greg led the pavement design team that prepared the pavement design drawings and report tendered by the Thiess John Holland (TJH) Joint Venture to Transurban and Roads and Maritime Services of NSW.

Greg designed and detailed the rigid and flexible pavement structures for the project, reviewed TJH's pavement design report and supervised the development of the pavement design drawings by Hyder's drafting teams. As a member of the F3M2 project management team, Greg also reviewed and provided invaluable input into the drainage, structural and traffic management design packages.
