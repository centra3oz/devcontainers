The project involves widening the rail corridor between Epping and Thornleigh stations and installing 6km of bi-directional non electrified dedicated freight line. A large percentage of the materials delivered to and exported from the construction site will be transported by road. Due to his expert pavement engineering knowledge, Greg was asked by the ETTT Alliance to advise them on how best to mitigate and minimise the damage to the pavements of local roads that would be trafficked by ETTT construction vehicles.

Greg has carried out several pavement dilapidation surveys for the ETTT Alliance and recommended effective pavement maintenance strategies including intervention response times and standards. Greg has also carried out a dilapidation survey on the rail bridge over the M2 motorway and the heritage bridge over Devlin Creek at Epping as well as surveys of the M2 motorway adjacent to the ETTT construction sites.
