#### Swan Hill Bridge over the Murray river

Swan Hill Bridge built in 1896, is a seven span structure, that includes one lift span supported on cast iron piers, Allan timber truss spans on either side of the lift span supported on one end by the cast iron piers and on the other end by timber trestle piers, and 4 timber girder approach span (one on the Victorian side and 3 on the NSW side). The lift span is of lattice steel construction, both the tower and the main girder, with counterweights located on the side of the supporting columns. The lift span itself consists of a steel truss with transverse steel cross beams and timber stringers.

The Bridge is rated for GML (General Mass Limit) vehicles access, including 25m B-Doubles. The B-Double route detour is a round trip of 66 km via Nyah.

Andrew developed a staged maintenance management strategy to address the continuing deterioration of the structure:

| **Asset <br>Maintenance <br> Stage** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | **Required outcomes at end of each stage** |
| :------- |:-------------|
| 1a     | Temporary Support System to stabilise the structure and remove temporary load limit. Work for this stage is completed. Width restriction of 3.1m remains in place due to Bailey Support |
| 1b     | Structural repair/support of cast iron and wrought iron piers. Minimum 10 year design life. Installation of external steel truss on Truss Spans 2 & 4 and removal of Bailey Support and associated 3.1m width restriction |  
| 1c     | Structural support of timber piers 5 & 6 e.g. using external temporary support system or similar. Minimum 10 year design life. |   
| 1d     | Removal and replacement of temporary walkway. Ensure connectivity across the lift span of external truss spans and approach span walkway. Works to be designed and undertaken to ensure minimal outages in connectivity and without exposing walkway users to interactions with traffic. |
| 2      | Repair and restoration of timber Piers 2 & 4. Repair and restoration of timber truss Spans 2 & 4. Removal of temporary support systems. Renewal and replacement as necessary of decking and sheeting |
| 3 to 5 | Works beyond the current 10 year forward program to refurbish the structure |
