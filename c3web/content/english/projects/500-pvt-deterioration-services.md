### Dilapidation surveys, diagnostics & management

####  Design

Greg Wright has designed numerous residential and heavy duty pavements for a variety of
clients ranging from state road, port and airport authorities to local government.

For example, Greg designed and detailed the concrete pavements for the Gore Hill Freeway upgrade component of the $1.1 billion Lane Cove Tunnel project, the hardstand and internal road pavements for the $3.5 billion Victorian Desalination project and the rigid and flexible pavements for the $2.7 billion Clem7 project in Brisbane.

Greg also designed the concrete pavements for Taxiways G & F of the Sydney Airport and their flexible pavement connections to the DOM3 terminal and interconnecting taxiways GA1 and D.

#### Dilapidation surveys

Greg Wright has carried out numerous pavement dilapidation surveys for a variety of clients such as Energy Australia, Leighton Contractors and Lend Lease Engineering.

Greg's first dilapidation contract involved surveying by ten local roads in the Gosford City local government area to identify and map the distress exhibited that they exhibited before Energy Australia installed the steel posts that carry the 133 kV high tension cables.

Greg has also carried out several dilapidation surveys on local roads trafficked by construction vehicles accessing the rail corridor between Epping to Thornleigh and between Villawood and Cabramatta, Sydney, NSW.

#### Innovations

Greg Wright has designed several pavement innovations for a clients such as the Thiess John Holland Joint Venture (TJHJV) and the Leightons Bilfinger Berger Joint Venture (LBBJV).

For example, Greg designed the prefabricated components and process that TJHJV used to install the pavement lights in the unreinforced concrete slabs of the M2 Motorway at the western entry to the Lane Cove Tunnel.

Greg also designed several innovations for Brisbane's North South Brisbane Bypass (aka CLem7) tunnel project including anchoring the northern end of the tunnel's continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) to the cast in situ concrete cradle adjacent to the Clem7 tunnel's northern portal. Greg also recommended to LBBJV that the tunnel CRCP be longitudinally diamond ground to reduce its as built roughness to the specified level

#### Diagnostics
Greg Wright has performed numerous pavement diagnostic surveys to establish the cause(s) of observed pavement distress.

For example, Greg carried out several pavement investigations on secondary roads in the Darling Downs region for the Department of Main Roads, Queensland after the 2010 floods. These investigations revealed that the flood damage was, in part, due to the pavement base courses being either poorly constructed and/or designed and/or drained.

Greg has recently undertaken an interesting heavy duty pavement investigation to identify the cause(s) of the observed pavement damage at a logistics centre in Banksmeadow, Sydney.
Greg also carried out numerous pavement investigations while he was working for Hornsby Shire Council , Cessnock city Council and Lake Macquarie City Council.

#### Management
Greg Wright has developed pavement management programs for a variety of clients such as local government authorities, public works authorities and motorway owners.

For example, Greg developed six annual pavement management programs for Hornsby Shire Council between January 1995 and January 2001. This included subprograms comprising pavement rehabilitation, asphalt patching, crack sealing, bitumen enrichment and  resurfacing.  

Greg also developed a five year rolling works program for the Highland Highway in PNG for the Department of Works and a resurfacing program for the M2 Motorway in Sydney.

#### Verification/review
Greg Wright has verified and has reviewed a large number of pavements for a variety of clients ranging from state road and port authorities to local government.

For example, Greg verified the pavements for the $1.5 billion Port Botany Expansion project and the $2.0 billion Ipswich Motorway upgrade project and numerous pavement rehabilitation
designs for the Shire of Hinchinbrook in Queensland following the devastation of tropical
cyclone Yasi.

Greg also reviewed the pavements designed by Parsons Brinkerhoff (PB) for the Lane Cove
Tunnel and reviewed the pavements for the Enfield Intermodal logistics Centre, the M2
Motorway Upgrade and the E2U projects while he was working for AECOM.
